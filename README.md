# cli-skeleton
Skeleton for a php-cli-app.

## Installation
Clone or download this repo, then follow the guide in "Rename skeleton".

After that:
```bash
# download components
composer install

# build the phar
./build.sh
```

## Rename skeleon
Theres no fun in keeping the "Skeleton" name right, to change it, you need to change a few files:
* box.json
* bin/skeleton.php (Change App name)
* rename bin/skeleton.php
